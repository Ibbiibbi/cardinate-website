**Last updated:** February 2025

Cardinate ("we," "our," or "the app") is a TCG binder planner. This policy describes how we handle information.

### Information We Collect

- **Data stored on your device:** Your binders, card lists, and preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not upload this data to our servers.
- **Third-party services:** The app uses external APIs (e.g., RapidAPI) to fetch card data. Please refer to those services' privacy policies for how they handle requests.
- **Analytics:** We do not currently collect analytics or usage data.

### Data We Do Not Collect

We do not collect personal information such as name, email, or account credentials unless you explicitly contact us for support.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy. The "Last updated" date at the top reflects the latest version. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.
